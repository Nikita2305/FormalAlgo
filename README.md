# FormalAlgo

This library provides with C++ classes Grammar and abstract Algo to solve a task of checking whether a word belongs to grammar. There are also two implementations of Algo: ParserLR and Earley.

## How to launch

As it is just a library, I provided it with only tests that you can run with `./_run_tests.sh`. By the way, boost library for C++ is required for running tests.
